## 1. Parties and Relationship with JetBrains
- This End-User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is concluded between you (“You” or “Licensee”) and Enco, Private Entrepreneur (“Licensor” or “Developer”) with respect to the Plugin.
- JetBrains s.r.o. and its affiliates (together, “JetBrains”) are not parties to this Agreement and provide no warranties or obligations under this Agreement.
- JetBrains may act solely as a reseller and billing facilitator for the Plugin via JetBrains Marketplace and will process payments and remit proceeds to the Licensor subject to JetBrains’ terms and commission. JetBrains has no responsibility or liability arising from or related to this Agreement.

## 2. Grant of License (Object Code Only)
Subject to Your compliance with this Agreement and applicable payment/entitlement confirmation as managed via JetBrains Marketplace, the Licensor grants You a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:
- install and use the Plugin in compiled/object code form only, solely in accordance with applicable marketplace-managed entitlements and limits; and
- make reasonable backup copies for archival purposes.

The Plugin is licensed, not sold. Each permitted user must hold their own valid entitlement as managed via JetBrains Marketplace. Entitlements are personal, non-shareable, and may not be pooled or reassigned except as permitted by JetBrains Marketplace policies.

## 3. Restrictions
You shall not (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law):
- modify, translate, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Plugin;
- access or attempt to access the source code of the Plugin, or analyze the Plugin (including bytecode) to extract algorithms, trade secrets, or license mechanisms;
- sublicense, distribute, publish, disclose, resell, rent, lease, lend, or otherwise transfer the Plugin or any rights thereto;
- remove, alter, or obscure proprietary notices, copyright statements, watermarks, or license management information;
- disclose, publish, or share any license keys, activation data, or technical steps to bypass licensing;
- circumvent or attempt to circumvent licensing, metering, usage limits, technical protection measures, or subscription/entitlement mechanisms;
- use the Plugin to develop a functionally equivalent or competing plugin through reverse engineering or analysis, to the extent permitted by law.

## 4. Intellectual Property
All rights, title, and interest in and to the Plugin (including source code, object code, designs, algorithms, trade secrets, and documentation) are and will remain the exclusive property of the Licensor and its licensors. No rights are granted except as expressly stated in this Agreement. No implied licenses are granted.

## 5. No Source Code; No Open-Source Obligations
The Plugin is proprietary closed-source software. The Licensor does not provide or license the Plugin’s source code. Use of the Plugin within JetBrains IDEs does not, by itself, impose any open-source or copyleft obligations on Your projects.

## 6. Fees, Entitlements, and Management via JetBrains Marketplace
- Access to and use of the Plugin, including any time-limited rights or continuation/fallback rights (if any), are managed via JetBrains Marketplace in accordance with the Marketplace’s purchase, entitlement, and billing processes and the information made available to You there.
- If Your entitlement managed via JetBrains Marketplace lapses or is terminated, Your license to use the Plugin automatically terminates, except to the extent any continuation rights are explicitly provided to You via JetBrains Marketplace terms and confirmations.

## 7. Support, Updates, and Continuation Rights
- During a valid entitlement period managed via JetBrains Marketplace, You may receive updates or improvements that the Licensor makes generally available. Source-level materials are not included in updates or support.
- Any support or maintenance is provided at the Licensor’s discretion unless expressly stated in the Plugin’s Marketplace listing or required by applicable law.
- Any “fallback,” “perpetual,” or other continuation rights (if any) are solely as communicated through JetBrains Marketplace confirmations or listing details and are subject to this Agreement.

## 8. Confidentiality
The Plugin, its licensing/activation information, non-public documentation, and any other non-public information disclosed by the Licensor constitute the Licensor’s confidential information. You must not disclose such information to third parties or use it for any purpose other than using the Plugin as permitted by this Agreement.

## 9. Decompilation Exception (Interoperability)
Nothing in this Agreement limits any mandatory rights You may have under applicable law to decompile solely to achieve interoperability with independently created software, provided that (a) prior to any such decompilation, You make a written request to the Licensor for the information necessary to achieve such interoperability, and (b) any decompilation is limited to the extent permitted by law.

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranty
THE PLUGIN IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. YOUR USE OF THE PLUGIN IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. THE LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PLUGIN WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

## 11. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW:
- THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE PLUGIN, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
- THE LICENSOR’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE PLUGIN VIA JETBRAINS MARKETPLACE IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
- JETBRAINS HAS NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AS JETBRAINS IS NOT A PARTY TO IT.

## 12. Term and Termination
This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and continues until terminated. The Licensor may suspend or terminate Your license immediately if You breach this Agreement or if Your Marketplace-managed entitlement lapses or is revoked. Upon termination, You must cease all use of the Plugin and uninstall it. Sections intended to survive termination (including Sections 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15) shall survive.

## 13. Compliance with Third-Party Terms
Your use of the Plugin within JetBrains products is subject to Your compliance with applicable JetBrains Marketplace and JetBrains product terms and policies. You must comply with all such third-party terms.

## 14. Export Controls and Sanctions
You represent and warrant that You are not subject to, and will not use, export, re-export, or otherwise transfer the Plugin in violation of, any applicable export control or sanctions laws, including those of Ukraine, the EU, the UK, and the United States.

## 15. Privacy and Telemetry
The Plugin may process limited technical information necessary for licensing, activation, telemetry, diagnostics, or updates as described in the Plugin’s documentation or Marketplace listing. The Plugin does not collect or transmit Your project source code. No personal data is collected beyond what is necessary for these purposes unless otherwise stated. You should also review applicable JetBrains privacy documentation and policies.

## 16. Feedback
Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas that You provide regarding the Plugin may be used by the Licensor without restriction or obligation, and no source code access will be provided in connection with such feedback.

## 17. Assignment
You may not assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the Licensor’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment without such consent is void. The Licensor may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

## 18. Severability; Waiver
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. No failure or delay by the Licensor in exercising any right shall be deemed a waiver of that right.

## 19. Entire Agreement; Changes
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Licensor regarding the Plugin and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. The Licensor may update this Agreement from time to time. The version published in the Plugin distribution or Marketplace listing will govern upon publication. Continued use of the Plugin after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
